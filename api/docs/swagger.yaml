  title: "openDCIM"
  description: "openDCIM is an open source data center inventory management application.
    API documentation shows the primary model for the data being returned.   However, in many GET
    routes a union of multiple models are returned, which is why your results may vary.  For PUT
    and POST routes, you should only push the primary model.   Additionally, CustomDeviceAtrributes
    will be returned and can be posted, but are not in the documentation as they are custom by nature.
    Many routes that may seem to be missing are intentional, but we also acknowledge that we are filling
    out the routes as the need for them arise.  Prime example - there is no POST (edit) route for AuditLog,
    because of the very nature of what it is capturing."
