Destroying resources
====================

On your Proxmox API client object you can call the `delete()` function in order to change the state of a resource, depending on the resource type you will need to send an array filled with proper parameters.

Lets see how can we destroy the proxmox user *bob* which is using the realm *pve*:

```php
<?php

// Require the autoloader
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

// Create your credentials array
$credentials = [
    'hostname' => 'my.proxmox.tld',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => 'secret',
];

// Then simply pass your credentials when creating the API client object
$proxmox = new \ProxmoxVE\Proxmox($credentials);

// We use delete() function since we want to destroy a specified resource
$result = $proxmox->delete('/access/users/bob@pve');

print_r($result);

```

A successful request will output:

```php
Array
(
    [data] => 
)
```

But if instead we specify the user without realm we'll get an error:

```php
Array
(
    [errors] => Array
        (
            [userid] => invalid format - value 'bob' does not look like a valid user name

        )

    [data] => 
)
```

As you can see the `destroy()` function receives the desired resource path you want to destroy. In rare cases you may want to pass params to the `destroy()` function, in that cases you should pass params in an associative array as second a parameter, justs as *create*, *get* and *set* functions behave.

Search for the `errors` key in the `$result` array in order to know if your request was executed without errors.

**How can I know what resource paths are available and which params needs to be passed?**
