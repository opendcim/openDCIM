Welcome developers!
===================

Before making any contribution you should now:

- All code contribution should follow PSR-1 and PSR-2 coding style standards. (Thanks to [Alexey Ashurok](https://github.com/aotd1))
- You should code the tests for any function you add, some times is not possible but try doing it. Personally I like more the *black box* testing approach.
- All functions need to be properly documented, all comments, variable names, function names only on english language.
- Variables and functions names should be self descriptive.


Installation
------------

Of course you should [fork the repo](https://github.com/ZzAntares/ProxmoxVE/fork), then after cloning your forked repo:

```sh
$ composer install --dev  # Run command inside the project folder
```

What needs to be done?
----------------------

What ever you think will improve this library and also let's wait the people to open issues and then we'll see.
