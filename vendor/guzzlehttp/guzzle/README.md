Guzzle, PHP HTTP client and webservice framework
================================================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/guzzle/guzzle.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/guzzle/guzzle)

Guzzle is a PHP HTTP client that makes it easy to work with HTTP/1.1 and takes
the pain out of consuming web services.

```php
$client = new GuzzleHttp\Client();
$response = $client->get('http://guzzlephp.org');
$res = $client->get('https://api.github.com/user', ['auth' =>  ['user', 'pass']]);
echo $res->getStatusCode();
// "200"
echo $res->getHeader('content-type');
// 'application/json; charset=utf8'
echo $res->getBody();
// {"type":"User"...'
var_export($res->json());
// Outputs the JSON decoded data
```

- Pluggable HTTP adapters that can send requests serially or in parallel
- Doesn't require cURL, but uses cURL by default
- Streams data for both uploads and downloads
- Provides event hooks & plugins for cookies, caching, logging, OAuth, mocks,
  etc.
- Keep-Alive & connection pooling
- SSL Verification
- Automatic decompression of response bodies
- Streaming multipart file uploads
- Connection timeouts

### Installing via Composer

The recommended way to install Guzzle is through
[Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

```bash
# Install Composer
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

Next, update your project's composer.json file to include Guzzle:

```javascript
{
    "require": {
        "guzzlehttp/guzzle": "~4.0"
    }
}
```

After installing, you need to require Composer's autoloader:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```
