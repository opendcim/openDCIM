Installation
------------
Supposing you are using apache, php and apache-php-module firstly clone openDCIM in a directory which is accessible by apache user (e.g. /srv/http/) and then configure apache to load required modules and have access to project directory (you can define virtual host too).

If you're gonna create Dockerized development environment, you should enable apache's fast-cgi to connect to php-fpm's container

## Database (PDO, PDODRIVERS, DB.INC)

### Install and Configure Mysql and PHP-Mysql
Follow the [guide](http://php.net/manual/en/book.mysql.php)

### Create Database and Configuration File
Create the database and user
```shell
	mysql -uroot -p -e "CREATE DATABASE dcim;CREATE USER 'dcim'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'dcim';GRANT ALL ON dcim.* TO 'dcim'@'localhost';"
	mysql -udcim -pdcim < create.sql
```

Make db.inc.php from db.inc.php-dist
```shell
	cp db.inc.php-dist db.inc.php
```

## PHP SNMP Module
Install [php-snmp](http://php.net/manual/en/book.snmp.php) and enable it in `/etc/php/php.ini` by uncomment or adding the line containing: `extension=snmp.so`
