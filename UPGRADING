== Upgrading from a Previous Version ==

If you have already installed a previous version of openDCIM, you should 
be able to simply unzip and untar the distribution directly over the 
existing.  However, there could be some bugs that were not caught by 
the developers, so it is recommended that you extract the archive to a 
new directory and test it there against your dataset.  It is also 
possible that some files are removed or consolidated between versions, 
so if you want to keep the directly clean of any unused files, follow 
the instructions below for a safe migration setup.

=== Setting up a Safe Migration Test ===

1.  Make a copy of your database - if your production DB is called openDCIM, 
then dump it to a file, create a new database called test_openDCIM, and 
import the database into it.  Here's an example:

$ mysqldump --opt openDCIM > dbdump.sql
$ echo "create database dev_openDCIM" | sudo mysql -u root -p
$ echo "grant all on dev_openDCIM.* to '%'@'localhost'" | sudo mysql -u root -p
$ mysql dev_openDCIM < dbdump.sql

You'll need to adjust your grant statement to match your site specifics, 
but this should give you an idea of what's needed.

2.  Extract your archive to a folder (or different server) than what is 
already running, and configure your web server to serve that directory.  
Remember that you will still need to set up user authentication, so you 
will probably want to use SSL.

3.  Configure your db.inc.php file in the test root directory (Use 
db.inc.php-dist as a template).  Copy any data center drawings from the 
production drawings/ folder to the test drawings/ folder.  Copy any 
custom logo that you may have set up to the images/ folder of the 
test folder.

4.  Proceed to "The Cowboy Way"

== The Cowboy Way ==

Just drop the archive onto the existing install and browse to the appropriate
URL for your installation, and specifying the setup.php script:

https://dcim.yourdomain.com/

The setup script will automatically determine the current version and make any
database structural changes that are required to be up to date.

You will have to delete install.php after the upgrade is complete before you
will be able to continue.
