openDCIM is an Open Source Software alternative for Data Center Infrastructure Management.

This is a list of changes made from version to version.  This is not intended to be a
comprehensive bug tracking list.  Issues (bugs, enhancements, etc) are tracked on
GitHub, at http://github.com/samilliken/openDCIM/issues, where you can also download
the latest development version.  However, it is not advised to pull from GitHub unless you
are simply testing, as some functionality can break between releases.

Changes in 4.5
--------------
* Reservation is no longer a yes/no field.  Has been replaced with a user customizable list of Device Status values.
* The PathDrawing image for connections now has a print screen option.
* Fixtures, such as power panels, can now be mapped onto a data center drawing.
* Salvage process has been completely redone - now you can create Disposition Methods and when something leaves your custody, you can attach the device to that disposition method.  (Such as e-cycler, or returned to customer)
* New report added that will allow you to see all devices from a specific vendor and/or by a device type.
* Improvements to the API in terms of custom device attributes - they now work the same as native device attributes
* BUGS!  Several of them were fixed.

Changes in 4.4
--------------
* Fixed collision detection in the bulk importer
* Corrected issues where parent power panels didn't roll up inherited meter values
* Make Path now only shows available ports instead of all ports
* Allow PowerSupplyCount to be overridden for children of a Chassis Device.  This is helpful for the VTRAY and HTRAY hacks (shelves).
* Switched the whole dependency system over to PHP Composer and implemented AutoLoad.  This will only load the class files into the server that are actually being used by a page, thereby decreasing the overall load on the server and memory footprint.
* Updated all libraries to latest version supported by PHP 5.5, which also allows us to be compatible with PHP 7.0 (previously it threw fatal errors)
* Added some buttons on the work order screen to do some mass updates, like clearing the reservation flag on a bunch of devices at once
* Fixed the search box so that it doesn't send the whole db if you accidentally hit the down arrow with an empty search string
* Automagic conversion to/from English/Metric when talking to the Repository.
* Fixed the Repo Sync screen to acknowledge when you send a template to the repository
* Fixed an error that caused the Port Notes field to clear out when a color code wasn't chosen
* Added ability to search on Custom Attributes/Values, in both the UI and the API
* Allow for the creation of a Default Rights template, applied to any new user that authenticates past Apache, but doesn't exist in openDCIM database
* Fixed the Center of Gravity calculation.  It was a huge fan of Stranger Things, and calculated everything in the Upside Down.
* The port naming pattern maker from the devices.php screen has been copied over to the Template Maker screen.
* New option in Configuration to draw rectangles around the defined cabinet coordinates, as well as apply the label to the map.  Handy for users who simply want to upload a blank floor plan and draw with openDCIM.
* New option in the right click context menu - can align all cabinets in the selected row with a given edge of the current cabinet.  Strictly for OCD folks.
* Expanded some of the fields to larger containers.
* Fixed the Available RU calculation in the data center stats.  It was counting items in the Storage Room.
* Power Outage Simulation Report has been completely reworked and now outputs an Excel spreadsheet that is much easier to follow.
* Added an email report (must be added to crontab) that will notify you of devices disabled from SNMP Polling due to 3 consecutive failures.  Includes a button to reset all counters back to 0.
* If you add a tag of "NoPoll" to a switch device, it won't try to poll the status of it, even if you have a hostname/IP defined.
* Support for a BusWay type of power panel.  You still need to give each circuit a name, but it doesn't try to make it fit within the scope of a 42 pole panel - can be alphanumeric.
* Created a bulk importer for cabinets

Changes in 4.3.1
----------------
* Bug fixes (No DB changes or new functionality)

Changes in 4.3
--------------
* Removed support for repository_sync.php job - all synchronization to be done through the UI at this point.
* Addition of Bulk Upload operations (import, move, delete).  I hate you people.

* Expanded the rights so that you can give someone the ability to do Bulk Operations without being a Site Admin
* Ability to search by model name in the quick search bar
* Added a few statistics to the main home page
* Classes have been moved to the classes/ folder and broken into a single class per file.  Hopefully this will make it simpler for new contributors to find what they're looking for.
* Updated the main API searches (datacenter, people, cabinet, device) to support wildcards and also specify which attributes are returned.  See the WIKI.
* Major, major performance improvements, especially for installations with 10,000+ cabinets spread across multiple data centers.  Less of an improvement for large sites built out as very few data centers, but still some improvement.
* Added in a Project / Service Catalog capability.  Can now limit some reports based on the project.  (ie - These 35 servers make up my Exchange environment)
